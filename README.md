# Pykaboo

## Description

Hide and unhide files in images using steganography.

This is a simple script that allows you to hide and unhide files in images using steganography.

The hide function in the provided script uses a technique to hide
data in the PNG metadata. Rather than embedding the data in the pixel values
of the image, it instead embeds the data in the metadata of the PNG file.

Simply right click the image file you
want to use for storage, and select "Hide with Pykaboo". Then just select all of the
files you want to hide.
